## Brief Explanation 
This project involves developing an assembler – a software tool that translates symbolic assembly language into machine code – for a simulated computer system.
I developed this project for a CS class. Project grade - 100. 
The simulated computer consists of a CPU, a set of 8 general-purpose 24-bit registers, a program status word (PSW), and RAM (which includes a stack section). The system supports only integer arithmetic (using two's complement representation) and ASCII character encoding.
The assembler will read programs written in a custom assembly language and convert them into machine code according to a specific instruction format. Each machine instruction includes operation codes (opcodes), function codes, and one or more operands (sources and destinations). The machine code will be output in hexadecimal format.
